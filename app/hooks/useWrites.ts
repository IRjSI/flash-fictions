            He walked to the grand library as he did every day. Inside, people read silently, with the same pace, the same posture, the same expression… all uniform, all inevitable. They greeted him with a smile and a nod.

            His hat slipped from the table. “Excuse me,” he muttered to the woman next to him, bending to pick it up. His eyes caught her book. Written there, plain and unassuming, were the words:

            “…will buy a red-dotted black dress, a Vict…”

            He looked away, returning to his own reading.

            Later, during a break, he stepped outside for a walk. The woman had gone, leaving only the echo of her presence. As he sipped coffee, he spotted her down the street, with a red-dotted black dress and Victorian hat.

            Bored by the monotony of his thick, repetitive book, an idea struck him: What if I tear the pages?

            He began, carefully at first, ripping one page after another. The subtle shuffle of paper drew glances. At first, disapproving. Then, sharper. By the time he had torn half the pages, the readers’ eyes were dark with anger.

            Still tearing the pages, until only the last page remained: The End

            In the city of the tree with one flower, there stood a great tree with a single, enormous bloom.

            Most people had a spike fixed above their forehead; only a few did not.

            To see the flower was everyone’s dream. But they could not, the spike stopped them from looking up.

            Those without spikes saw the flower clearly and spoke of its beauty.

            The rest tried, but when the spike pierced deeper, they stopped.

            Some were not even aware of the spike, for they never tried looking up at all. They were content with the green grass under their feet.

            I had the spike too. I tried looking up once... but I failed.

            Many believed it was impossible, that only a chosen few could ever look up.

            But one day, we saw a man forcing his head upward.

            The spike cut through his skin; blood ran down his face.

            Still, he didn’t stop.

            Until, at last, the spike vanished.

            And he looked up, smiling, tears in his eyes.

            Surely, they were tears of joy.

            Now everyone knew the spike’s truth.

            But could they do the same?

            No. They couldn’t... I can’t.

            This is a café filled with peace and harmony. There is one rule you can never break: no one was allowed to scream.

            To enforce it, the owners devised a small device called the Decibel. It was fixed onto the customers, though not all the customers, because some of them understand the sanctity and necessity of such rule and they would never scream and disturb the peace and harmony of the café.

            I saw a man with the Decibel, sat near an old man and... he screamed. The old man was terrified, his peace was disturbed. The man's mouth was sealed that very moment. We called it "The Mask".

            I had the Decibel on me. I was terrified of The Mask.

            But today... the Decibel is gone. I don't know why, or how, but it's gone.

            And so, it happened,

            In a village, there lived a monster behind the glass. No one dared approach it. It was said that whoever went near would be devoured.

            “I want to see the monster!” said a youth to his friends.

            “There is no monster,” they laughed.

            But he believed otherwise.

            “I want to see the monster!” he told a wealthy, contented man.

            The man chuckled. “Ha! Ha! There is no monster.”

            “I want to see the monster!” he told his teacher.

            The teacher thought for a moment. “Go into the deepness of the forest, and there you will find the glass behind which lives the monster...”

            So the boy went to the glass.

            “Monster! Monster! Are you there?” he called.

            Silence.

            “Monster! I know you exist, show yourself!”

            A sudden gleam struck his eyes. It was the glass, and behind it stood the monster.

            They spoke. The boy asked,

            “Why do you kill? Why do you hate? Why are you not happy?”

            The monster answered,

            “Because no one accepts me…”

            “If I do,” the boy asked, “will you stop?”

            “Yes, for you.”

            But as night began to fall, the boy recalled his teacher’s warning:

            "Do not linger with the monster when darkness rises."

            Still, he stayed. And stayed.

            Until only the monster walked away.

            I was born to eat the apple, like my friend. But it was far away. Still, we began our journey together. A snake slid past us, flowing across the ground faster than me. I told my friend to crawl like it. He refused, and kept moving as he was born to. So I became like the snake, crawling as it crawled. A rabbit leapt through the field, covering more ground than my crawling. So I leapt as the rabbit leapt. An eagle tore the sky apart with its speed. So I tried to cut the wind as it did. I looked back. My friend was far behind, still moving as before. Though he had improved to balance himself and move a little faster. A cheetah chased across the earth itself, faster than anything I had ever seen. So I ran as the cheetah ran. My friend arrived soon after and ate it. But I never did. Because cheetahs don't eat apples. I had forgotten what I was born to do.

            There he fell again. It worries me.

            Don’t worry too much, he is still young. He will learn eventually. I hope so.

            Since I was a kid, I have always had a friend. Everyone has one. But lately, I have spent too much time with him, and my family has become angry and sad. They were furious, but I know it’s because they care. They said I should focus on myself now.

            Everyone says, “Your friend will ruin you.”

            A boy who also had a friend killed him for similar reasons.
            A boy who didn’t kill his friend is now a happy man, still living with him.
            A boy who didn’t kill his friend was killed by him.

            I don’t know if I should kill my friend or not. I am confused. He is very dear to me, but so is my family. If I don’t kill him, my family won’t be happy. If I kill him, I won’t be happy.

            I was eating the grass. Then the lion came, furious, his teeth like ice. I ran, trembling, but I ran.

            I killed the deer and carried it to my family. Together we circled the lion and chased him away. Together we ate the deer.

            I raised the gun to his forehead, his sweat dripping. A cold barrel pressed against my forehead, though I could not see, for I was blindfolded. I killed him.

            And every time I killed myself, I saw that nothing was ever killed. For I am not the cat, nor the rat, nor the deer, nor the lion, nor the man. I am the whole.

            A thorn had grown so large that it covered half the window. He looked at it and kept looking. The crack deepened.

            He stood, took the thorn cutter, and began trimming. The edges were jagged, uneven. The crack receded slightly.

            He picked up the broken flower, looked at it with a faint smile, and tossed it aside. The crack vanished completely.

            Heaven, where the creatures live together. They have no mouths, only eyes, and endless consciousness. They are small, pink, and soft as breath, without limbs to touch or grasp.

            They float and wait, each one deciding, in its own time, what it will become in the worlds below.

            Some imagine wings and oceans, some teeth and claws, some quiet lives in forgotten corners. Every wish is granted.

            But one creature stared into the void and thought: I will be feared. I will be a monster. Fierce, powerful, hateful, unjust, and cruel. I want the world to tremble at my name.

            The moment the thought was complete, its body dissolved into a thousand shreds of light.

            It opened its two eyes.

            Two hands.

            It screamed.

            A heart that could hate and hunger.

            It had been granted its wish.

            To whom it may concern,

            During the vacations, I went trekking. While packing my bags, I accidentally took my office ID with me.

            I was exploring there when I dropped my ID somewhere along the way. A man found it and handed it back to me. He seemed like a local.

            “Hey, you dropped this,” he said. I thanked him and took my ID.

            He was a painter. He painted for the tourists. He asked if I would like one. I sat on a chair; behind me stretched a magnificent view, vast mountains capped with snow, brushed with a faint tint of green. A very vivid, colourful view. Though his paintings followed a particular scheme of mostly three colours: Green, yellow and red.

            While he painted, we discussed the scenery, the tourists, and how much he loves painting tourists. At some point, I asked how much he earned doing what he does.

            “Bare minimum to feed myself,” he replied. “But I’m happy, though. It gives me thrills,” he added with a smile.

            “Do you love what you do?” he asked.

            After a pause, I said, “Not quite,” with a smile, a forced one, perhaps.

            “Then why do it?”

            “To feed myself, I guess.”

            “You can feed yourself doing what you love as well,” he said. “Like me.”

            I was submerged in deep thinking after hearing those words.

            “What do you love, by the way?” he interrupted my thoughts.

            “Writing,” I said.

            I don’t know what happened in that moment. It was… a life-changing moment. Sometimes, such moments seem ordinary to one person but completely transform another. For me, it did. I decided I would follow my passion.

            “It’s done,” he declared. He had finished the painting. It was beautiful.

            “It’s beautiful. I’ll keep this in my office when I become an established writer.”

            “Thinking about following your passion, huh? Not bad.” He remarked with a smile.

            “Thinking.”

            “My friend there sells notebooks and pens, maybe you’ll need one,” he said.

            I left my ID there and went with him to buy a notebook and a pen.

            Maybe I will see my office and colleagues again after a long time, if I can.

            I am writing this in the notebook I bought, with the painting beside me. It’s dark here; I can barely write. I think it’s a basement. I don’t know where I am. My head hurts. There’s a little blood on my hand and shirt. I guess it was not painting that he loved. I don’t think this letter will ever find you.

            I miss my office.

            Thanking you,

            Yours faithfully,

            —
